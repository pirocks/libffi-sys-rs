The C libffi library provides two main facilities: assembling calls
to functions dynamically, and creating closures that can be called
as ordinary C functions. This is an undocumented wrapper, generated
by bindgen, intended as the basis for higher-level bindings, but you
can see the [C libffi
documentation](http://www.atmark-techno.com/~yashi/libffi.html).

If you clone this repository in order to build the library, be sure to
do a recursive clone, as we include C libffi as a submodule.

See [the libffi crate](https://crates.io/crates/libffi/) for a
higher-level API.

## Usage

Building libffi-sys will build the libffi C library [from
github](https://github.com/libffi/libffi), which requires that you have
a working make, C compiler, automake, autoconf, and texinfo first.
Itâ€™s [on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/libffi-sys), so you
can add

```toml
[dependencies]
libffi-sys = "0.7.0"
```

to your `Cargo.toml` and

```rust
extern crate libffi_sys;
```

to your crate root.

If you clone from github, be sure to `clone --recursive` to get the C
libffi.

This crate supports Rust version 1.32 and later.
